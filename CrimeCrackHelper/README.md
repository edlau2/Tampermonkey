# Torn Crime Crack Helper

This is a slightly modified version of the Torn Crime Crack Helper created by [nodelore[2786679]](https://www.torn.com/profiles.php?XID=2786679)

The original can be found here:
[Nodelore's cracking script](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=67&t=16372731&b=0&a=0)

Once I had gotten to level 100 in cracking and was just doing it for the 10k cyber crimes merit, I didn't really always need the hints, 
but sometimes still usefull as cracking is 5 nerve compared to 7 for the brute force option. And it does take a bit longer to load, and 
takes up screen real estate.

So this simply adds a button in the top status bar that says "Start!", and when pressed will run the script as normal. It is an option, 
you can change the line around 46 that says "const demandStart = true;" to false to disable (not show) the button and run as it always has.
Yes nodelore I know should prob go in the config section, but I already had that big comment above it....
